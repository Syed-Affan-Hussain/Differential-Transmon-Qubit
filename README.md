# Differential Transmon with CPW

## Overview
This repository contains a Qiskit Metal implementation of a differential transmon qubit with coplanar waveguide (CPW) connections based on the research paper "Surface loss calculations and design of a superconducting transmon qubit with tapered wiring". The design is integrated with Ansys HFSS for eigenmode and energy participation ratio (EPR) analyses.



## Requirements
To use this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install qiskit-metal numpy matplotlib
```

For HFSS integration, ensure Ansys HFSS is installed and properly configured.



## Future Improvements
There are some mesh convergence issues while running the Analysis which will be corrected shortly

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
